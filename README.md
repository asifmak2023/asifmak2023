- 👋 Hi, My Name is Muhammad Asif, I have a MCS (Master of Computr Science) Degree from Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science, and Technology.
- 👀 Currently I am enrolled in Governor Sindh Program for Generative AI Program, where I have completed all my assignments well before course completion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript and Python, and still I am feeling quite confident to program in these, because again I am covering course outlines well before time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Generative AI, Data Science, Image Processing, and web development. I have made a number of projects on image processing, time series analysis, batch image processing, and many internal use websites
